## Short Bio
I was born in Tetouan, a northern Mediterranean city in Morocco 🪬 . When I was 3 years old, I moved to Tarragona 🏖️, another northern Mediterranean city in Spain, where I lived until it was time to start university.

I pursued a double **bachelor's degree** in **Physics and Mathematics** at the Autonomous University of Barcelona (**UAB**), focusing on Theoretical Physics (though I will always cherish my mathematician side 🤓). 

Afterwards, I decided to pursue a **master's degree**, which led me to Munich, where I studied **Quantum Science and Technology** at the Technical University of Munich (**TUM**) and Ludwig Maximilian University (**LMU**). In my final year, I completed my Master’s Thesis at **BMW Group**, contributing to the expansion of a benchmarking quantum framework for quantum machine learning and conducting related studies.

In March 2024, I took a "quantum jump" to Singapore 🇸🇬 , where I worked in [Dimitris Angelakis](https://www.quantumlah.org/research/group/D-Angelakis)' group on Quantum Algorithms, Optimisation, QML, and related topics in the Center of Quantum Technologies (**CQT**).

I recently joined [Richard Küng's](https://www.jku.at/en/institute-for-integrated-circuits-and-quantum-computing/about-us/philosophy-quantum-computing/) group as a PhD student at Johannes Kepler University in Linz.

## Research Interests
I am interested in Quantum Machine Learning. In my research I would like to study quantum learning settings where the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics leads to an inductive bias in a quantum model that matches the structure it has to learn from a particular kind of dataset. 

## Personal Interests 
I am also fervent on defending and advocating for **equality and diversity in STEM fields**, specially on Quantum  🌍 . I participated on the Erasmus + ["Diversity in the Cultures of Physics: A European Summer School"](https://www.genderportal.eu/resources/diversity-cultures-physics-european-summer-school-curriculum) project and I am part of the EDIphy committee at National University of Singapore (NUS).

Beyond my quantum endeavours, I love to read  📚 ([here](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/203651.Curated_list_od_books_that_shaped_me) you can check some books that shaped me), travel in a conscious and sustainable way, and crochet 🧶  items for my fashion wardrobe and stimulate creative brain side. I also balance my workout routine with different activities like Muay Thai 🥊, Barre 🩰, Calisthenics 🏋️‍♀️ or Yoga 🧘.
