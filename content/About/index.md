I research how classical shadows shed light on estimating meanigful information in quantum objects and how randomness lies at their core. I'm supervised by [Richard Küng.](https://www.jku.at/en/institute-for-integrated-circuits-and-quantum-computing/about-us/philosophy-quantum-computing/)

            
I was born in Tetouan and raised in Tarragona, two places alike in their Mediterranean nature but con
trasting in culture. I moved a little north to Barcelona to study Physics and Mathematics, then further north to Munich for a master’s in Quantum Science and Technology. Later, for a change, I moved south to work at the Centre for Quantum Technologies in Singapore.

Now in Linz, I try to find my new routine biking along the Danube and spending time in the Alpine mountains. I care deeply about the world beyond academia and about how activism can manifest in everyday choices.
