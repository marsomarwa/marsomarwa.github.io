Hi, I’m Marwa.  

I’m a PhD student at **JKU Linz**, where I think about:  
* **quantum information** — how information lives, moves, and hides inside quantum systems, using glimpses of their shadows  
* **quantum machine learning** — using quantum devices as learners themselves  

Outside the office, I crochet, and I like to travel or read to understand how people find meaning in different places.  
When I can, I chase waves trying to master the slow, non-linear art of [surfing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsrYg4nDeDE&list=RDMsrYg4nDeDE&start_radio=1).
