      <description>One of those endless lockdown days, I was studying for my History of Physics exam, working through fragments of the Einstein-Bohr debates on the epistemology of quantum mechanics. It was during one of those study sessions that I first came across the name Grete Hermann—a name buried at the bottom of the page, but a contribution that, as I’d soon learn, far exceeded the confines of a mere footnote.&#xA;Grete Hermann was one of those anachronistic figures, whose ideas seemed out of step with her time, yet ahead of it in hindsight.</description>
